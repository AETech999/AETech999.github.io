                    <h2>WHAT IS VR?</h2>
                    <p>Virtual Reality (VR) is something you can read about, but really have to try for yourself to truly understand how amazing an experience this is.</p>
                    <p>Using cutting edge technology we take you to new worlds using simulated environments that feel so real you feel like you're really there.</p>
                    <p>You are placed in interactive environments with two controllers. Unlike traditional user interfaces, VR places you inside an immersive experience. Instead of viewing a computer screen in front of you, in VR you are surrounded by and are able to interact with 3D worlds.</p>
                    <p>Through two screens in a head mounted display each eye gives you true stereoscopic vision providing a convincing sense of real world depth.</p>
                    <p>At Unreal VR, we use very high end equipment with advanced tracking, ultra powerful PCs and stereoscopic vision through  twin 1080x1200 resolution AMOLED displays that feature a refresh rate of 90Hz, to ensure the most realistic experience possible.</p>

                    <h2>IS VR FOR ME?</h2>
                    <p>Virtual Reality (VR) is for everybody! Whether you’re still in school or in your 80'</p>
                    <p>We tailor the experience to you. Whether you’re the creative type, looking for a challenge to test your skills or maybe wanting to try some bone chilling horror.</p>
                    <p>We have all types of experiences! Come get up close with an 80ft whale while surrounded by fish, stingrays and turtles while standing on the bottom of the ocean. Challenge yourself in a Virtual Puzzle Room or just fight some zombies with friends.</p>

                <section>
                    <p>A VR experience can involve the thrill of games and testing your skills, or just relaxing while exploring gorgeous exotic environments which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to visit.</p>
                    <p>Or you might decide to use VR to be creative in new ways, or to undertake some 3D design.  There is also a range of educational applications so you can learn construction skills, or take an informative tour inside the human body.</p>
